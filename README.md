# Iterative client-server
Developed for Advanced C Programming (CS 591) in Fall 2017, each lab represents a step towards the "ultimate" client-server.

Each folder has a makefile which can be used to make each client and server. More details for each particular implementation can be found in the particular folder:

- [Lab 1](https://github.com/taylorflatt/client-server/tree/master/Lab1)
- [Lab 2](https://github.com/taylorflatt/client-server/tree/master/Lab2)
- [Lab 3](https://github.com/taylorflatt/client-server/tree/master/Lab3)
- [Lab 4](https://github.com/taylorflatt/client-server/tree/master/Lab4)
- [Lab 5](https://github.com/taylorflatt/client-server/tree/master/Lab5)

The code was written with Linux in mind and doesn't necessarily conform to POSIX standards. Verify code before reuse.
